# Gap Analysis: Legacy Agent vs Recac (Go)
This document outlines the functions and features present in the Legacy Agent (`information/combined-autonomous-coding`) specifications that are currently missing or incomplete in the `recac` (Go) implementation.

## 1. Dynamic Configuration Management
**Status**: MISSING
The legacy specification defines a robust CLI-based configuration system. The current Go implementation uses `viper` for reading configuration but lacks commands to modify it interactively.

*   **Missing Commands**:
    *   `agent config set <key> <value>`: Ability to update settings without manual YAML editing.
    *   `agent config list-keys`: Interactive discovery of available settings.
    *   `agent config list-models`: Listing compatible models for the active provider.
    *   **Context-Aware Hints**: Suggestions for invalid configuration values.

## 2. Integrated Jira Workflow
**Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED / DISJOINTED
While `recac` has a `jira` command group (`test-auth`, `get`, `transition`), it lacks the seamless integration into the main execution loop described in the legacy spec.

*   **Missing Integration**:
    *   `agent run --jira <TICKET_ID>`: A single flag to initialize a session context directly from a Jira ticket.
    *   **Workspace Isolation**: Automatic management of temporary workspaces specific to a Jira task.
    *   **Bi-directional Status Sync**: The legacy spec implies continuous status updates during the run, whereas `recac` only supports explicit manual transitions via `recac jira transition`.

## 3. Intelligent Pre-flight Checks (Workspace & Environment)
**Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
`recac` implements robust Docker checks (`check-docker`), but lacks general environment and workspace validation.

*   **Missing Checks**:
    *   **Workspace Validation**: "Git Clean Check" to ensure the project directory is safe for modification before starting.
    *   **Dependency Auto-Fix (Non-Docker)**: Automatically handling minor local issues like creating missing non-project directories or fixing local file permissions.

## 4. Advanced Log Management
**Status**: INCOMPLETE
The legacy spec promises "Smart Logs" with streaming and filtering. The current `recac` implementation is basic.

*   **Missing Functionality**:
    *   **Log Following (`-f`)**: The `--follow` flag in `logs.go` is currently a stub: `(Follow mode not yet implemented - showing current logs)`.
    *   **Smart Filtering**: No ability to filter logs by priority level or category to avoid terminal clutter.
