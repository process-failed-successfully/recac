# PROJECT MANAGER ANSWERS

## GENERAL GUIDANCE:
Q: What should be our testing strategy?
A: Use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests.
   - Unit tests: Test individual functions in isolation with mocks
   - Integration tests: Test component interactions with real dependencies
   - E2E tests: Test complete workflows with Docker containers

Q: How should we handle configuration?
A: Use viper for configuration management with the following priorities:
   1. Command line flags
   2. Environment variables
   3. Config file (config.yaml)
   4. Default values

Q: What logging standard should we use?
A: Use structured logging with log levels:
   - Debug: Detailed information for debugging
   - Info: General operational information
   - Warn: Warning conditions
   - Error: Error conditions
   - Fatal: Critical errors that require immediate termination

## SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS:
Q: Should we use interfaces or concrete types?
A: Use interfaces for all external dependencies (Docker, JIRA, LLM providers) to enable testing and flexibility.

Q: How to handle long-running processes?
A: Use context.Context for cancellation and timeouts. Implement proper graceful shutdown.

Q: Error handling pattern?
A: Use Go 1.13+ error wrapping with fmt.Errorf and errors.Is/As for error inspection.

## DOCKER SPECIFICS:
Q: Container lifecycle management?
A: Implement health checks, automatic restarts for failed containers, and proper resource cleanup.

Q: Volume and network management?
A: Use named volumes for persistence and create isolated networks for security.

## NEXT STEPS:
1. Focus on test coverage first
2. Then implement missing features
3. Finally, polish documentation and error handling
