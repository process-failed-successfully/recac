## 2025-03-05 - Avoid repeatedly compiling regular expressions
**Learning:** Compiling a regular expression is a relatively expensive operation because it parses the pattern and constructs a state machine. Compiling it inside a function means it gets re-compiled every single time the function is called.
**Action:** Always hoist `regexp.MustCompile` to the package level as a global variable. This ensures it is compiled exactly once when the package is initialized, which is a classic and highly recommended Go performance optimization.
