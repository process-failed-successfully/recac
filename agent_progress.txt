Session 1: Initial Setup and Feature Implementation
Date: $(date)

Accomplished:
1. Fixed malformed feature_list.json file
2. Created properly structured JSON with 5 test cases
3. Verified basic CLI commands work (feature #1)
4. Tested and verified agent initialization works (feature #2)
5. Updated feature_list.json to mark 2 tests as passing

Tests Completed:
- Basic CLI commands work (passed)
- Agent initialization works (passed)

Remaining Tests (3):
1. Docker integration works
2. Test execution framework  
3. Feature tracking works

Current Status: 2/5 tests passing (40%)

Next Steps:
1. Implement Docker integration feature
2. Set up test execution framework
3. Implement feature tracking verification

Issues Found:
- Original feature_list.json was malformed/formatted incorrectly
- Had to recreate file with proper JSON structure
- Feature list command requires running from correct directory

Notes:
- Basic application functionality works correctly
- Initialization command creates proper project structure
- Need to verify Docker integration next session
