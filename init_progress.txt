Initialization Session - Complete
===============================

Date: $(date)
Status: Foundation established

Created Files:
1. feature_list.json - 35 comprehensive test cases covering all system components
2. init.sh - Development environment setup script
3. README.md - Project documentation
4. .gitignore - Git ignore patterns

Updated Files:
1. .gitignore - Enhanced with additional patterns

Project Structure:
- cmd/recac/ - CLI commands (existing)
- internal/ - Core packages (existing)
- docs/ - Documentation directory (created)
- examples/ - Example projects (created)
- scripts/ - Utility scripts (created)

Next Steps for Next Agent:
1. Review feature_list.json for completeness
2. Begin implementing highest priority features
3. Start with 'recac init' command implementation
4. Set up basic Docker development environment

Priority Features to Implement:
1. recac init - Project initialization wizard
2. recac start - Development environment startup
3. recac feature - Feature management system
4. Basic UI dashboard

Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for all internal packages
- Integration tests for Docker operations
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths

Notes:
- All tests in feature_list.json start with "passes": false
- Features can only be marked as passing, never removed or edited
- This ensures complete tracking of all requirements
