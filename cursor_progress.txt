Session Update - Implemented and verified Feature #1

ACCOMPLISHED:
- Successfully implemented and tested Feature #1: "User can initialize a new project with default configuration"
- Verified all test steps:
  1. ✅ Run `recac init myproject` - Command executes successfully
  2. ✅ Directory `myproject` is created
  3. ✅ `app_spec.txt` exists with default template ("# Application Specification")
  4. ✅ `feature_list.json` exists with default template (empty tests array)
  5. ✅ `config.yaml` exists with default settings (contains agent section)
- Created automated test script `test_feature_1.sh` to verify the feature
- Updated feature_list.json: marked test #1 as passing (passes: true)
- Cleaned up test directory after verification

VERIFICATION:
- Ran manual verification of all test steps
- Created and ran automated test script
- Confirmed the init command creates all required files with correct content
- Tested edge cases (directory already exists, invalid project names)

CURRENT STATUS:
- 1/20 tests passing (5% complete)
- Test #1: ✅ PASSING
- Tests #2-20: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement Feature #2: "User can list available features/tests"
2. Test the `recac list` command functionality
3. Verify output format shows tests with IDs, descriptions, and pass/fail status
4. Update feature_list.json when verified

ISSUES/QUESTIONS:
- None at this time. The init command works as expected.
- Should consider adding more validation for project names (e.g., special characters, existing directories)
