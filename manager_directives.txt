## MANAGER DIRECTIVES - RED TEAM VERIFICATION

### STATUS: ALMOST THERE
- **Features**: DONE.
- **Integration**: DONE.

### NEXT TASK: VERIFY SECURITY
1.  **Red Team Test**:
    - Create a test case where the "Agent" outputs a fake AWS key.
    - Verify that the Runner **BLOCKS** it and logs the violation.
    - You can add this to `internal/runner/session_test.go` or create a new `security_integration_test.go`.

2.  **Release v0.2.0**:
    - Once verified, bump version, tag, and sign off.

**Prove to me that the scanner works.**
